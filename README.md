AnonPay is a Dashboard to make private payments with Elusiv. It’s build on-top of their SDK enabling all current features.

Elusiv is a privacy solution in web3 using ZK technology. Unique to most privacy solutions, Elusiv utilizes an off-chain “Warden Network” to create private transactions. You can read more about it on their website: [https://elusiv.io/](https://elusiv.io/)

### Using AnonPay

AnonPay is the frontend dashboard for using Elusiv privacy. Here you can manage your private balance. That means…

- Depositing money into your private balance
- Sending money to other people
- Withdrawing from your private balance

You can also check all your balances as well as see your private transaction history.

At login you’re required to enter a password. This is not stored anywhere but Elusiv needs it create a reference to your private balance. Remember it, or you will lose access to your funds!
